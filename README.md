webpy_django_sample
===================

web.py django sample - shows how django can be used with web.py

web.py has a rather weak connection to anything one might wish to call a database; there is no ORM with web.py at-all.


See also: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/django-standalone for some insights into how this was done.

The project template provides support for both mysql and sqlite3 however any django db backend could be used; these are
the ones I chose to use for my sample.
